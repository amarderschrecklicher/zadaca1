Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for expression evaluation
		 	 	 						
Arithmetic expression evaluation. 
As another example of stack usage, we consider a classic example that also demonstrates the utility of generics, 
involving computing the value of arithmetic expressions like this one:			
( 1 + ( ( 2 + 3 ) * ( 4 * 5 ) ) )				

If you multiply 4 by 5, add 3 to 2, multiply the result, and then add 1, you get the value 101. 
But how does the Java system do this calculation? Without going into the details of how the Java system is built, we can address the 
essential ideas by writing a Java program that can take a string as input (the expression) and produce the number represented by the expression as output.

THIS CODE WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT ENTERING SPACES AFTER EVERY NUMBER OR OPERAND AND IT REQUIRES TWO NUMBERS AND A OPERATOR FOR ONE SET OF BRACKETS.
